this will be were everything that is left to do will be if you finish something remove it or add something that need/should be on the site
this is in no order

I will also say, I would add names if you are doing something. That way there is no overlap, though at this point tiny overlap
wouldn't be too bad.

• implement the search bar - Abdi

• implement the "sort by..." feature - Cleveland

• password recovery - Abdi

• when logged in as a student clicking a teacher it should show their profile -Daniel

• Add delete function to student lists so teachers can delete old students (This instead of adding year 3s, 4s, 5s, etc) 

• iPad Formatting where necessary - Reid

• when signing up you only be able to choose one teacher
• on signup merge year with Class (Cosmetology 1 = year 1, Cosmetology 2 = year 2)

• when creating a client it should bering you back to the home page (there is also a email error that happens no matter what email is in there but it doesn't stop the clients creation)

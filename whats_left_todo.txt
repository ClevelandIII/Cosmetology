this will be were everything that is left to do will be if you finish something remove it or add something that need/should be on the site
this is in no order


• implement the search bar

• implement the "sort by..." and add one to the list

• password recovery

• make it so that students can see their teachers if the name of teacher === teacher name

• add a "click to load more" for all lists

• when logged in as a teacher and when clicking on a student it should go to there profile page

• For clients, if there is already a client that visits again, we have to make a popup that can add another visit.
(The popup should look somewhat similar to the one you get when you click on a client in your profile)

• decide if the ratings feature needs to be implemented.

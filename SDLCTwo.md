- Cleveland: (Please Read) Set Navbar files to two separate ones for work conservation. Mine is the NormNavbar one, and Daniels is the SignupLoginNav one. Mine has a sidebar instead of the button navbar design because it works better with more pages, the other navbar can have the buttons since there isnt much to display.
